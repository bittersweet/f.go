# f.go

Find files in your working directory by regex with colored results.

Yes I know you can do this with a couple of shell scripts but it's more fun
learning a language when you build something you can use every day :-)

## Installation

This builds and moves it to `/usr/local/bin/`
``` bash
$ make
```

## Usage

``` bash
$ f query
```
